                <h1>MAIZE</h1>
                <p>Maize is a widely cultivated crop in South Africa, with a growth cycle ranging from 60 to 100 days depending on the variety.
                    Optimal planting occurs between late October and mid-December, aligning with regional rainfall patterns in provinces like Mpumalanga, Free State, and North West.
                    Maize thrives in deep, nutrient-rich soils with good drainage and a pH above 4.5, ideally between 30–60 cm in depth. Adequate sunlight and temperatures between 19°C and 25°C are crucial during flowering.
                    For dryland maize, annual rainfall of 500–750 mm is essential, with watering every 3–7 days based on growth stage and climate. Drip irrigation significantly boosts grain yield by optimizing water delivery. Fertilizer needs are modest, focusing on phosphorus and potassium during the growing season.
                    Seed spacing should be 13–15 cm apart to ensure healthy development and maximize productivity. With careful timing and resource management, maize offers high yields and remains a cornerstone of South African agriculture.</p>
