                        <p>
                            <strong>Growth Duration:</strong> Maize matures in 60 to 100 days depending on the variety. Early hybrids grow faster, while late-season types take longer.<br><br>

                            <strong>Optimal Growing Seasons:</strong> In South Africa, plant between late October and mid-December. Timing depends on rainfall onset in dryland regions.<br><br>

                            <strong>Water Requirements:</strong> Requires 500–750 mm of rainfall annually. Supplemental irrigation may be needed during dry spells. Water every 3–7 days depending on growth stage.<br><br>

                            <strong>Soil Requirements:</strong> Prefers deep, well-drained soil with good texture and structure. pH should be above 4.5. Lime may be added to correct acidity.<br><br>

                            <strong>Sunlight Needs:</strong> Full sun is essential for photosynthesis and grain development.<br><br>

                            <strong>Temperature Tolerance:</strong> Flowering occurs best between 19°C and 25°C. Extreme heat or cold can reduce yield.<br><br>

                            <strong>Fertilizer Needs:</strong> Requires phosphorus and potassium during growth. Nitrogen boosts leaf and stalk development.<br><br>

                            <strong>Irrigation Needs:</strong> Drip irrigation improves water efficiency and grain yield. Depth and frequency affect productivity.<br><br>

                            <strong>Seed Spacing & Density:</strong> Space plants 13–15 cm apart. Rows should be spaced to allow airflow and light penetration.
