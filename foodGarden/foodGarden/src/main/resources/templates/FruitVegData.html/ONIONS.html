                  <h1>ONION</h1>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Growth Duration:</strong> Onions take 90–100 days from seed, or up to 6 months from planting to harvest. Bulb formation depends on day length and temperature.<br><br>

                            <strong>Optimal Growing Seasons:</strong> Plant from February to April, transplant in May–June, and harvest from September to November. Cooler months support better bulb development.<br><br>

                            <strong>Yield Per Area:</strong> Yields range from 15 to 40 tons per hectare. Early hybrids can exceed 50 tons, with top-performing farms reaching 80+ tons.<br><br>

                            <strong>Water Requirements:</strong> Requires 350–550 mm of water annually. Water 1–3 times per week depending on growth stage and climate.<br><br>

                            <strong>Soil Requirements:</strong> Prefers deep, loamy, well-drained soil with pH 6.0 to 6.8. Avoid compacted or saline soils.<br><br>

                            <strong>Sunlight Needs:</strong> Needs 6–8 hours of direct sunlight daily. Insufficient light reduces bulb size and quality.<br><br>

                            <strong>Temperature Tolerance:</strong> Grows best between 13°C and 24°C. Hardy down to –6°C, but frost can damage young plants.<br><br>

                            <strong>Fertilizer Needs:</strong> Balanced NPK fertilizer supports leaf and bulb development. Micronutrients like sulfur and magnesium may be needed.<br><br>

                            <strong>Irrigation Needs:</strong> Drip irrigation improves water efficiency and reduces disease risk.<br><br>

                            <strong>Seed Spacing & Density:</strong> Rows spaced 20–30 cm apart; plants 8–10 cm apart. Sowing density ranges from 1500 to 2500 seeds per m².
