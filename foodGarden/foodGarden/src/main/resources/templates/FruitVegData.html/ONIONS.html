                <h1>ONION</h1>
                <img src="pictures\onion.jfif" alt="A picture of an onion" class="onion1">
                <h2>Growth Duration:</h2>
                <p>Onions take 90–100 days from seed, or up to 6 months from planting to harvest. Bulb formation depends on day length and temperature. In South Africa, the timing can vary depending on the region and climate, with cooler provinces like the Western Cape and Free State often producing larger, firmer bulbs. Onions are usually sown directly into the soil or started in seed trays for transplanting. Germination is quick, often within a week, and regular thinning helps ensure healthy, full bulbs. With staggered sowing, you can enjoy a continuous supply of fresh onions throughout the season, making them a staple in local gardens and urban plots. Good care and regular feeding with compost or organic fertiliser encourage robust growth and strong flavour.</p>
                <h2>Optimal Growing Seasons:</h2>
                <p>Plant from February to April, transplant in May–June, and harvest from September to November. Cooler months support better bulb development. In South Africa, autumn and winter plantings are popular, especially in the Western Cape and Gauteng, where cooler temperatures help produce crisp, sweet bulbs. Summer planting is possible in shaded areas or with heat-tolerant varieties, but extra care is needed to prevent bolting. Succession planting every few weeks ensures a steady harvest, and using mulch can help protect young seedlings from sudden temperature changes.</p>
                <h2>Yield Per Area:</h2>
                <p>Yields range from 15 to 40 tons per hectare. Early hybrids can exceed 50 tons, with top-performing farms reaching 80+ tons. In home gardens, onions are often grown in raised beds or containers to ensure loose, fertile soil. South African growers use drip irrigation and organic mulches to maintain moisture and reduce weed competition, which helps boost yields. Regular monitoring for pests like thrips and aphids is important for healthy crops. With good care, onions can be harvested over several months, providing a fresh addition to meals and salads.</p>
                <h2>Water Requirements:</h2>
                <p>Requires 350–550 mm of water annually. Water 1–3 times per week depending on growth stage and climate. In South Africa’s drier regions, supplemental irrigation is often necessary, particularly during hot spells or windy weather. Drip irrigation is recommended to deliver water directly to the roots and minimise evaporation. Mulching with straw or bark chips helps retain moisture and keeps the soil temperature stable. Consistent watering is essential for producing crisp, tender onion bulbs.</p>
                <h2>Soil Requirements:</h2>
                <p>Prefers deep, loamy, well-drained soil with pH 6.0 to 6.8. Avoid compacted or saline soils. In South Africa, soils can be sandy or clay-based, so adding organic matter is often necessary to improve structure and nutrient availability. Onions are sensitive to compacted soil, so regular cultivation and aeration help maintain good root development. Avoid using fresh manure, as it can cause excessive leaf growth at the expense of bulb formation. Good drainage is essential, as onions do not tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>

                <h2>Sunlight Needs:</h2>
                <p>Needs 6–8 hours of direct sunlight daily. Insufficient light reduces bulb size and quality. South African gardeners often plant onions in spots that get morning sun and afternoon shade, especially in regions with intense summer heat. Too much shade can result in leggy plants and small bulbs, while too much sun in hot weather can cause stress and early bolting. If growing in containers, move them to follow the sun or use shade cloth during heatwaves to protect the crop and extend the harvest window.</p>
                <h2>Temperature Tolerance:</h2>
                <p>Grows best between 13°C and 24°C. Hardy down to –6°C, but frost can damage young plants. In South Africa, onions are best grown during the cooler months to avoid heat stress and bitterness. Protecting young plants from sudden temperature changes with mulch or row covers can help maintain steady growth. With the right care, onions can be grown successfully in many parts of the country, providing a flavourful addition to meals throughout the season.</p>
                <h2>Fertilizer Needs:</h2>
                <p>Balanced NPK fertilizer supports leaf and bulb development. Micronutrients like sulfur and magnesium may be needed. In South Africa, many gardeners prefer organic fertilisers such as chicken manure or commercial blends tailored for root vegetables. Feed your onion plants in early spring and again after the first flush of growth. Regular feeding and consistent watering will help your onions grow strong and produce abundant, tasty bulbs. Good nutrition also helps the plants resist pests and diseases, ensuring a healthy crop throughout the season.</p>
                <h2>Irrigation Needs:</h2>
                <p>Drip irrigation improves water efficiency and reduces disease risk. In South Africa, drip systems are increasingly popular for conserving water and delivering moisture directly to the roots. Irrigation should be adjusted based on soil type and weather, with more frequent watering during hot, dry spells. Monitoring soil moisture helps prevent stress and supports steady growth throughout the season.</p>
                <h2>Seed Spacing & Density:</h2>
                <p>Rows spaced 20–30 cm apart; plants 8–10 cm apart. Sowing density ranges from 1500 to 2500 seeds per m². Proper spacing helps prevent disease and ensures each plant has enough room to develop strong roots and bulbs. In South Africa, farmers often use mechanical planters for large fields, while home gardeners can sow seeds by hand, making sure to keep rows straight and evenly spaced. Good spacing also makes it easier to weed, fertilise, and harvest the crop.</p>
