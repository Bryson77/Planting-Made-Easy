                <h1>ONIONS</h1>
                <p>Onions take about 90 to 100 days to mature from seed, with planting in late summer to early autumn and harvesting from September to November.
                    They grow best in deep, well-drained loamy soil with a pH of 6.0 to 6.8 and need 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight daily. Optimal growth occurs between 55°F and 75°F, with water requirements ranging from 350 to 550 mm annually.
                    Drip irrigation is preferred for efficiency and disease prevention. A balanced fertilizer program supports healthy leaf and root development. For spacing, rows should be 20–30 cm apart, with 8–10 cm between plants. Yields can range from 15 to over 40 tons per hectare.</p>
