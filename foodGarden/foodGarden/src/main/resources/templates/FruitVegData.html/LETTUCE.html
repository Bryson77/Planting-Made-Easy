                            <strong>Growth Duration:</strong> Lettuce matures in 60 to 90 days depending on the variety. Leaf types grow faster than head-forming varieties like iceberg.<br><br>

                            <strong>Optimal Growing Seasons:</strong> Lettuce thrives in cool weather, ideally between 16°C and 18°C. Plant in early spring or autumn to avoid heat stress and bolting.<br><br>

                            <strong>Yield Per Area:</strong> Yields typically range from 20 to 30 tons per hectare under good management. Proper spacing and pest control help maximize output.<br><br>

                            <strong>Water Requirements:</strong> Requires consistent moisture, especially during germination and head formation. Overwatering can lead to root rot, while underwatering causes bitterness.<br><br>

                            <strong>Soil Requirements:</strong> Prefers well-drained, loamy soil rich in organic matter. Ideal pH is between 5.5 and 7.0. Compost improves structure and fertility.<br><br>

                            <strong>Sunlight Needs:</strong> Full sun is preferred, but partial shade helps in warmer climates to prevent bolting.<br><br>

                            <strong>Temperature Tolerance:</strong> Can grow between 7°C and 18°C, but optimal growth occurs between 16°C and 18°C. High temperatures reduce quality and yield.
