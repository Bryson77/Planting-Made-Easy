                <h1>LETTUCE</h1>
                <p>Lettuce is a fast-growing, cool-season crop typically harvested 60 to 90 days after sowing, with optimal growth occurring at temperatures between 16°C and 18°C.
                    It thrives in well-draining, loamy soil rich in organic matter, with a pH range of 5.5 to 7, and requires consistent moisture throughout the growing season.
                    While full sun is ideal, lettuce can tolerate partial shade, especially in warmer climates. Yields generally range from 20 to 30 tons per hectare under normal conditions, making it a productive choice for small-scale and commercial growers alike.</p>
