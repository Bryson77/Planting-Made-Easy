                <h1>CARROTS</h1>
                <p>Carrots are cool-season crops that grow best in loose, sandy soil with consistent moisture and full sun exposure.
                    They should be planted in early spring, a few weeks before the last frost, or in autumn about 10â€“12 weeks before the first frost.
                    Depending on the variety, carrots take 55 to 80 days to mature and require 1 to 2 inches of water per week to prevent cracking or forking.
                    Ideal soil conditions include a pH between 6.0 and 6.8, free of stones and clumps to support straight root development. With proper spacing, thinning, and moderate nitrogen application, yields can range from 9 to 18 metric tons per acre, making carrots a productive and rewarding crop for both home and commercial growers.</p>
