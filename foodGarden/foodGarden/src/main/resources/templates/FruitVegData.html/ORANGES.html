             <h1>ORANGE</h1>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Growth Duration:</strong> Orange trees typically begin bearing fruit 3 to 5 years after planting, with full production reached around year 8.<br><br>

                        <strong>Optimal Growing Seasons:</strong> Oranges thrive in subtropical climates with mild winters and warm summers. In South Africa, planting is best done in spring or early summer in regions like Limpopo, Mpumalanga, and KwaZulu-Natal.<br><br>

                        <strong>Yield Per Area:</strong> Commercial yields vary by variety and management, ranging from 25 to 70 tons per hectare under optimal conditions.<br><br>

                        <strong>Water Requirements:</strong> Oranges require regular irrigation, especially during flowering and fruit development. Drip or microsprinkler systems are ideal to deliver 500–1,300 mm of water annually depending on climate.<br><br>

                        <strong>Soil Requirements:</strong> Best grown in well-drained sandy loam or loamy soils with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Organic matter and proper fertilization improve productivity.<br><br>

                        <strong>Sunlight Needs:</strong> Full sun exposure is essential—at least 6 to 8 hours daily.<br><br>

                        <strong>Temperature Tolerance:</strong> Ideal temperatures range from 13°C to 38°C. Frost and extreme heat can damage fruit and reduce yield.<br><br>

                        <strong>Fertilizer Needs:</strong> Apply balanced NPK fertilizers with micronutrients based on soil analysis. Fertilize three times a year—typically in July, December, and March.<br><br>

                        <strong>Spacing & Orchard Design:</strong> Trees are spaced 3 to 5 meters apart, with rows 4 to 8 meters apart depending on rootstock and variety.
