                <h1>ORANGES</h1>
                <p>Orange trees are relatively easy to grow from seed, but they require patience, as it can take between seven to fifteen years before they bear fruit. They thrive in warm regions of South Africa with high rainfall or access to irrigation, but do not do well in extremely cold or coastal subtropical climates.
                    For healthy growth, orange trees need about one inch of water per week, ideally through drip irrigation, and should be planted in loamy, nutrient-rich, well-draining soil with a slightly acidic to neutral pH of 6.0 to 7.0.
                    Full sunlight—eight to ten hours a day—is essential for producing sweet, flavorful fruit, and the ideal temperature range for growth is between 60°F and 90°F.
                    When planting, space standard trees about 20 feet apart and dwarf varieties around 10 feet.Although orange trees are self-fertile, planting more than one can attract pollinators and boost fruit production.</p>
