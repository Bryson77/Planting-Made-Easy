                <h1>ORANGE</h1>
                <img src="pictures\orange.jfif" alt="A picture of an orange" class="Orange1">
                <h2>Growth Duration:</h2>
                <p>Orange trees typically begin bearing fruit 3 to 5 years after planting, with full production reached around year 8. In South Africa, the timeline can be influenced by climate, soil quality, and whether the tree is grown from seed or grafted stock. Grafted trees are preferred by most local growers because they produce fruit sooner and more reliably. Young trees spend their first years developing a strong root system and healthy branches, which is essential for supporting future harvests. Once established, orange trees can produce fruit for decades, with peak yields often reached after 10 years. Regular feeding, watering, and pruning help ensure consistent production and healthy, juicy fruit. In regions like Limpopo and Mpumalanga, oranges are a staple crop, and with good care, trees can provide a steady supply for both home and commercial growers.</p>
                <h2>Optimal Growing Seasons:</h2>
                <p>Oranges thrive in subtropical climates with mild winters and warm summers. In South Africa, planting is best done in spring or early summer in regions like Limpopo, Mpumalanga, and KwaZulu-Natal. Planting during the warmer months allows young trees to establish before the cold sets in. In cooler areas, it’s important to protect young trees from frost, which can damage tender shoots and flowers. Mulching and windbreaks can help shield trees from harsh conditions. With the right timing, oranges can be grown successfully in many parts of the country, providing a reliable harvest year after year.</p>
                <h2>Yield Per Area:</h2>
                <p>Commercial yields vary by variety and management, ranging from 25 to 70 tons per hectare under optimal conditions. In home gardens, a mature tree can produce between 100 and 300 fruits per season, depending on the variety and care. South African commercial growers often use irrigation and fertilisation to boost yields, and regular thinning of fruit can help improve size and quality. Good orchard management, including pest and disease control, is key to achieving high yields year after year.</p>
                <h2>Water Requirements:</h2>
                <p>Oranges require regular irrigation, especially during flowering and fruit development. Drip or microsprinkler systems are ideal to deliver 500–1,300 mm of water annually depending on climate. In drier regions, supplemental irrigation is essential, particularly during hot spells or windy weather. Mulching helps retain moisture and keeps the soil temperature stable. Overwatering should be avoided, as soggy soil can lead to root rot and other fungal problems. Consistent watering is crucial for producing sweet, juicy oranges.</p>
                <h2>Soil Requirements:</h2>
                <p>Best grown in well-drained sandy loam or loamy soils with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Organic matter and proper fertilization improve productivity. In South Africa, soils can be sandy or clay-based, so adding compost or well-rotted manure before planting helps improve structure and fertility. Oranges are sensitive to compacted soil, so regular cultivation and aeration help maintain good root development. Good drainage is essential, as oranges do not tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>
                <img src="pictures\orangeplant.jfif" alt="A picture of an orange" class="Orange2">
                <h2>Sunlight Needs:</h2>
                <p>Full sun exposure is essential—at least 6 to 8 hours daily. In South Africa, orange orchards are often positioned to maximise sunlight, as shade can reduce yields and lead to poor fruit quality. If growing in a home garden, avoid planting orange trees near tall trees or buildings that may block sunlight. Good sunlight helps produce sweet, flavourful fruit and healthy foliage.</p>
                <h2>Temperature Tolerance:</h2>
                <p>Ideal temperatures range from 13°C to 38°C. Frost and extreme heat can damage fruit and reduce yield. In South Africa, oranges are best grown in regions with mild winters and warm summers. Protecting young trees from sudden temperature changes with mulch or row covers can help maintain steady growth. With the right care, oranges can be grown successfully in many parts of the country, providing a refreshing addition to meals throughout the season.</p>
                <h2>Fertilizer Needs:</h2>
                <p>Apply balanced NPK fertilizers with micronutrients based on soil analysis. Fertilize three times a year—typically in July, December, and March. In South Africa, many growers use organic fertilisers such as chicken manure or commercial blends tailored for citrus. Regular feeding and consistent watering will help your orange trees grow strong and produce abundant, tasty fruit. Good nutrition also helps the plants resist pests and diseases, ensuring a healthy crop throughout the season.</p>
                <h2>Spacing & Orchard Design:</h2>
                <p>Trees are spaced 3 to 5 meters apart, with rows 4 to 8 meters apart depending on rootstock and variety. Proper spacing helps prevent disease and ensures each tree has enough room to develop strong roots and branches. In South Africa, commercial orchards are often laid out to maximise airflow and sunlight, which helps produce high-quality fruit. Good spacing also makes it easier to prune, fertilise, and harvest the crop.</p>
