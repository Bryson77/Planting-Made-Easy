             <h1>ORANGE</h1>
             <h2>Growth Duration:</h2>
             <p>Orange trees typically begin bearing fruit 3 to 5 years after planting, with full production reached around year 8.</p><br><br>
         
             <h2>Optimal Growing Seasons:</h2>
             <p>Oranges thrive in subtropical climates with mild winters and warm summers. In South Africa, planting is best done in spring or early summer in regions like Limpopo, Mpumalanga, and KwaZulu-Natal.</p><br><br>
         
             <h2>Yield Per Area:</h2>
             <p>Commercial yields vary by variety and management, ranging from 25 to 70 tons per hectare under optimal conditions.</p><br><br>
         
             <h2>Water Requirements:</h2>
             <p>Oranges require regular irrigation, especially during flowering and fruit development. Drip or microsprinkler systems are ideal to deliver 500–1,300 mm of water annually depending on climate.</p><br><br>
         
             <h2>Soil Requirements:</h2>
             <p>Best grown in well-drained sandy loam or loamy soils with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Organic matter and proper fertilization improve productivity.</p><br><br>
         
             <h2>Sunlight Needs:</h2>
             <p>Full sun exposure is essential—at least 6 to 8 hours daily.</p><br><br>
         
             <h2>Temperature Tolerance:</h2>
             <p>Ideal temperatures range from 13°C to 38°C. Frost and extreme heat can damage fruit and reduce yield.</p><br><br>
         
             <h2>Fertilizer Needs:</h2>
             <p>Apply balanced NPK fertilizers with micronutrients based on soil analysis. Fertilize three times a year—typically in July, December, and March.</p><br><br>
         
             <h2>Spacing & Orchard Design:</h2>
             <p>Trees are spaced 3 to 5 meters apart, with rows 4 to 8 meters apart depending on rootstock and variety.</p>
