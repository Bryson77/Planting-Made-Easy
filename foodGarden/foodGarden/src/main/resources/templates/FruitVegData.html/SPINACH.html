                <h1>SPINACH</h1>
                <p>Spinach is a cool-season crop that thrives in South Africa from August to April, with planting times influenced by local climate and rainfall patterns.
                    Ideal germination occurs between 7°C and 24°C, with the fastest growth seen at 15°C to 18°C. Spinach requires a steady and uniform water supply—never allowing the soil to dry out—while maintaining good drainage to avoid saturation.
                    It grows best in fertile, sandy loam soils rich in organic matter, with an optimal pH range of 6.2 to 6.9. The crop tolerates full sun to light shade and benefits from preplant phosphorus application between 56 and 112 kg/ha.
                    Sprinkler irrigation is commonly used to support seed germination. For spacing, rows should be 50–60 cm apart, with 15–20 cm between plants, and a planting depth of about 20 mm when seeded directly. With proper care, spinach offers a high-quality, nutrient-rich harvest.</p>
