                            <strong>Growth Duration:</strong> Spinach can be planted from August to April. It matures quickly, often within 30–45 days, but continuous harvesting is possible.<br><br>

                            <strong>Optimal Growing Seasons:</strong> Germinates between 2°C and 30°C; optimal growth occurs between 15°C and 18°C. Avoid planting in hot weather.<br><br>

                            <strong>Water Requirements:</strong> Requires constant moisture. Soil should never dry out, especially during early growth. Overhead irrigation or sprinklers are commonly used.<br><br>

                            <strong>Soil Requirements:</strong> Prefers fertile, sandy loam with high organic matter. pH should be between 6.2 and 6.9. Avoid waterlogged or acidic soils.<br><br>

                            <strong>Sunlight Needs:</strong> Tolerates full sun to light shade. In hot climates, partial shade helps prevent bolting.<br><br>

                            <strong>Fertilizer Needs:</strong> Apply phosphorus before planting (56–112 kg/ha). Nitrogen may be added during growth to support leaf production.<br><br>

                            <strong>Irrigation Needs:</strong> Sprinkler irrigation ensures uniform moisture and supports seed germination.<br><br>

                            <strong>Seed Spacing & Density:</strong> Rows should be 50–60 cm apart; plants 15–20 cm apart. Direct seeding depth is about 20 mm.
