                     <p>
                            <strong>Growth Duration:</strong> Field-grown cucumbers mature in 55 to 60 days, while greenhouse varieties may take over 70 days.<br><br>

                            <strong>Optimal Growing Seasons:</strong> Plant when soil temperatures exceed 15째C. Cucumbers are sensitive to frost and grow best in warm conditions.<br><br>

                            <strong>Water Requirements:</strong> Cucumbers are heavy feeders, requiring 1 to 2 inches of water per week. Increase watering during flowering and fruiting stages.<br><br>

                            <strong>Soil Requirements:</strong> Fertile, well-drained soil with a pH of 6.5 to 7.5 is ideal. Add compost or aged manure to boost fertility.<br><br>

                            <strong>Sunlight Needs:</strong> Full sun exposure is essential for healthy growth and fruit development.<br><br>

                            <strong>Temperature Tolerance:</strong> Optimal growth occurs at 30째C during the day and 18째C to 20째C at night. Extreme heat may cause fruit deformities.
