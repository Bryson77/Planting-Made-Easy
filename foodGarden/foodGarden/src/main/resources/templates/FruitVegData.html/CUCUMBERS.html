                <h1>CUCUMBERS</h1>
                <p>Cucumbers are fast-growing, warm-season crops that typically mature in 55 to 60 days when field-grown, while greenhouse varieties may take over 70 days.
                    They should be planted once soil temperatures exceed 15°C and thrive in full sun with daytime temperatures around 30°C and nighttime temperatures between 18°C and 20°C.
                    Cucumbers require fertile, well-drained soil with a pH of 6.5 to 7.5 and are heavy water feeders, needing 1 to 2 inches of water per week—especially during flowering and fruiting stages. Consistent moisture and warm conditions are key to producing healthy, high-yielding cucumber plants.</p>
