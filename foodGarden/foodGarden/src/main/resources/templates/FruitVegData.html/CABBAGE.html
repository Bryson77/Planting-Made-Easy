                <h1>CABBAGE</h1>
                <p>Cabbage is a cool-season crop that thrives in temperatures between 15°C and 21°C, maturing in 60 to 100 days after transplanting depending on the variety.
                    It requires fertile, loamy soil with a pH of 6.0 to 6.8, full sun exposure, and consistent moisture—about 25 to 40 mm of water per week. In South Africa’s drier regions, irrigation is essential, especially during head formation.
                    Yields range from 25 to 70 tonnes per hectare, with optimal spacing of 45 to 60 cm between plants. A balanced NPK fertilizer and regular pest control help ensure healthy growth and high productivity.</p>
