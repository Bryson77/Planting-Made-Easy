        <h1>APPLE</h1>
            <p>
                <strong>Fruit-Bearing Timeline:</strong> Standard apple trees take up to 8 years to produce fruit, while dwarf varieties begin yielding in 2–3 years.<br><br>

                <strong>Planting Season:</strong> They grow best when planted in spring or winter in mild, moist climates.<br><br>

                <strong>Soil Requirements:</strong> Ideal soil should have a pH between 6 and 7 and must be well-drained to prevent waterlogging.<br><br>

                <strong>Sunlight & Temperature:</strong> Apple trees need full sunlight and temperatures ranging from 18°C to 24°C for growth, and 21°C to 27°C for fruit development.<br><br>

                <strong>Watering Needs:</strong> Watering should be adjusted based on soil type and weather, typically between 18–38 liters every 1–2 weeks.<br><br>

                <strong>Fertilization & Irrigation:</strong> Nitrogen-rich compost supports healthy growth, and irrigation systems like soaker hoses or sprinklers are recommended.<br><br>

                <strong>Spacing Guidelines:</strong> Proper spacing—ranging from 1.8 to 7.6 meters depending on tree type—ensures optimal sunlight exposure and development.
