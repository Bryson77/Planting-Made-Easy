                <h1>SWEET POTATOES</h1>
                <p>Sweet potatoes are warm-season crops that take between 90 and 150 days to mature, depending on the variety. In South Africa, the optimal planting period is from January to March, aligning with spring and early summer.
                    They thrive in permeable, nutrient-rich soil with a slightly acidic to neutral pH of 6.0–6.5 and require full sun exposure for 6 to 8 hours daily. Sweet potatoes need 450 to 600 mm of water throughout the growing season—while drought-tolerant, consistent moisture is key to achieving high yields.
                    Ideal temperatures range from 29°C to 35°C, with irrigation helping mitigate heat stress above 38°C. With proper care and fertilization using nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus, yields can reach 25 to 30 tons per hectare, with top-performing farms exceeding 40 tons.</p>
