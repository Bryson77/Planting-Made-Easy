              <h1>SWEET POTATO</h1>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Growth Duration:</strong> Sweet potatoes take 90 to 150 days to mature. Varieties like Beauregard and Georgia Jet mature faster (90 days), while Jewel and Stokes take up to 120 days.<br><br>

                        <strong>Optimal Growing Seasons:</strong> Best planted from January to March. Warm soil and long days support vigorous growth.<br><br>

                        <strong>Yield Per Area:</strong> Yields typically range from 25 to 30 tons per hectare, with top-performing farms exceeding 40 tons.<br><br>

                        <strong>Water Requirements:</strong> Requires 450 to 600 mm of water during the growing season. While drought-tolerant, consistent moisture improves yield and quality.<br><br>

                        <strong>Soil Requirements:</strong> Prefers permeable, slightly acidic soil (pH 6.0–6.5) rich in nutrients and organic matter. Avoid compacted or waterlogged soils.<br><br>

                        <strong>Sunlight Needs:</strong> Needs 6 to 8 hours of full sunlight daily. Shade reduces tuber size and sweetness.<br><br>

                        <strong>Temperature Tolerance:</strong> Thrives in warm, humid conditions between 29°C and 35°C. Temperatures above 38°C may slow growth but are manageable with irrigation.<br><br>

                        <strong>Fertilizer Needs:</strong> Requires nitrogen for vine growth, potassium for tuber development, and phosphorus for root health.
