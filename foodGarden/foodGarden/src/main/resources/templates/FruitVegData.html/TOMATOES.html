                        <p>
                            <strong>Growth Duration:</strong> Tomatoes take 60 to over 100 days to harvest depending on the variety. Early types mature faster, while indeterminate varieties produce fruit over a longer period.<br><br>

                            <strong>Optimal Growing Seasons:</strong> In South Africa, sow seeds between August and January. Start seedlings indoors and transplant after the last frost when soil warms up.<br><br>

                            <strong>Water Requirements:</strong> Tomatoes need 1–2 inches of water per week. Deep, consistent watering is crucial during flowering and fruiting. Drip irrigation is ideal to reduce disease and conserve water.<br><br>

                            <strong>Soil Requirements:</strong> Tomatoes prefer well-drained, fertile soil with a slightly acidic pH of 6.2 to 6.8. Adding compost improves structure and nutrient retention.<br><br>

                            <strong>Sunlight Needs:</strong> Full sun exposure—at least 6 to 8 hours daily—is essential for fruit development.<br><br>

                            <strong>Temperature Range:</strong> Optimal growth occurs between 26°C and 29°C. Tomatoes tolerate 10°C to 34°C but may suffer in extremes.<br><br>

                            <strong>Fertilizer Needs:</strong> Use a balanced NPK fertilizer with calcium and magnesium. Avoid excess nitrogen to prevent leafy growth at the expense of fruit.<br><br>

                            <strong>Irrigation Needs:</strong> Drip irrigation delivers water directly to the root zone, minimizing evaporation and promoting healthy growth.<br><br>

                            <strong>Seed Spacing & Density:</strong> Space plants 24–36 inches apart; rows 4–5 feet apart to ensure airflow and light penetration.
