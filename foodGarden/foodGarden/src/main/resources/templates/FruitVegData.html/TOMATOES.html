                <h1>TOMATOES</h1>
                <p>Tomatoes are a versatile and rewarding crop that thrive in warm, sunny conditions with well-drained, slightly acidic soil.
                    In South Africa, the ideal planting season spans from August to January, with indoor seedling preparation recommended for early starts.
                    These plants require consistent moisture—ideally through drip irrigation—and benefit from balanced fertilization rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and essential trace elements.
                    Proper spacing between plants ensures healthy airflow and light penetration, reducing the risk of disease. With optimal temperatures between 26°C and 29°C and full sun exposure, tomatoes can flourish and produce a bountiful harvest within 60 to 100 days, depending on the variety.</p>
