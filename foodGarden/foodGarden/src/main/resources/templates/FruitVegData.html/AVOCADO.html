               <h1>AVOCADO</h1>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Growth Duration:</strong> Standard avocado trees take 4 to 15 years to bear fruit, while grafted trees can produce within 2 to 3 years.<br><br>

                            <strong>Optimal Growing Seasons:</strong> Spring and summer promote active growth and flowering. In cooler months, growth slows or stops, especially in frost-prone areas.<br><br>

                            <strong>Yield Per Area:</strong> Average yields range from 12 to 16 tons per hectare, with top-performing farms reaching up to 22 tons.<br><br>

                            <strong>Water Requirements:</strong> Requires 1,000 to 1,300 mm of water annually. Regular watering is crucial during flowering and fruit set.<br><br>

                            <strong>Soil Requirements:</strong> Prefers well-drained soil with a pH between 5 and 7. Rich organic matter improves root health and nutrient uptake.<br><br>

                            <strong>Sunlight Needs:</strong> Needs 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight daily. Protect young trees from strong winds and excessive heat.<br><br>

                            <strong>Temperature Tolerance:</strong> Thrives between 16°C and 29°C. Temperatures outside this range can hinder growth or damage fruit.
