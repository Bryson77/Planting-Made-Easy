                <h1>AVOCADO</h1>
                <p>Avocado trees are long-term investments, typically taking 4 to 15 years to bear fruit, though grafted varieties can produce within 2 to 3 years.
                    In South Africa, growth slows during cooler autumn and winter months, while spring and summer bring vigorous new growth and flowering.
                    These trees require well-draining, nutrient-rich soil with a pH between 5 and 7, full sun exposure for 6 to 8 hours daily, and protection from strong winds.
                    Avocados are heavy water consumers, needing 1,000 to 1,300 mm of rainfall annually, especially during fruit set.
                    Ideal temperatures range from 16°C to 29°C—conditions outside this range can hinder growth or damage the tree.
                    With proper care, yields can reach 12 to 16 tons per hectare, with top-performing farms producing up to 22 tons.</p>
