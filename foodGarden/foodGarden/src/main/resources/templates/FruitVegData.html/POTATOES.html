                <h1>POTATOES</h1>
                <p>Potatoes are a cool-season crop that typically take 90 to 120 days to mature, with early varieties ready in as little as 60 days.
                    In South Africa, planting is best done between mid-February and mid-April. They thrive in well-drained, fertile soil with a slightly acidic pH of 5.8 to 6.5, and require full sun and cooler temperatures to ensure healthy tuber development.
                    Over the growing season, potatoes need around 500 to 700 mm of water, with yields commonly targeting 50,000 to 70,000 plants per hectare.</p>
