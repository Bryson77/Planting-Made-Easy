                <h1>POTATO</h1>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Growth Duration:</strong> Potatoes mature in 90–120 days. Early varieties are ready in 60–80 days, while late-season types take up to 130 days.<br><br>

                        <strong>Optimal Growing Seasons:</strong> Plant from mid-February to mid-April. Cooler temperatures support tuber formation.<br><br>

                        <strong>Yield Per Area:</strong> Target 50,000–70,000 plants per hectare. Yields vary based on variety, soil, and irrigation.<br><br>

                        <strong>Water Requirements:</strong> Requires 500–700 mm of water over the season. Consistent moisture is crucial during tuber bulking.<br><br>

                        <strong>Soil Requirements:</strong> Prefers well-drained, fertile soil with pH 5.8–6.5. Avoid waterlogged or compacted soils.<br><br>

                        <strong>Sunlight Needs:</strong> Full sun exposure is essential for healthy foliage and tuber development.<br><br>

                        <strong>Temperature Tolerance:</strong> Cooler temperatures (15°C–20°C) are ideal. High heat can reduce tuber quality and yield.<br><br>

                        <strong>Fertilizer Needs:</strong> Requires nitrogen for leaf growth, phosphorus for root development, and potassium for tuber quality.<br><br>

                        <strong>Irrigation Needs:</strong> Drip or furrow irrigation helps maintain consistent moisture and prevents disease.<br><br>

                        <strong>Spacing & Density:</strong> Space plants 30 cm apart in rows 75 cm apart. Adjust spacing based on variety and soil type.
