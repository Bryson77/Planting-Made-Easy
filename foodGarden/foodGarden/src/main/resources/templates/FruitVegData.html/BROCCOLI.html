                <h1>BROCCOLI</h1>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Growth Duration:</strong> Broccoli takes 70 to 100 days to mature from seed, depending on the variety. Early types are ready in 60–75 days, while late-season varieties may take longer.<br><br>

                            <strong>Optimal Growing Seasons:</strong> Best planted in cooler months—February to April. Ideal temperatures range from 10°C to 20°C, which promote compact head formation.<br><br>

                            <strong>Yield Per Area:</strong> Yields range from 5 to 12 tons per hectare, averaging around 8 tons. Proper spacing, pest control, and soil fertility are key to maximizing output.<br><br>

                            <strong>Water Requirements:</strong> Requires 250–300 mm of water per week. Soil should remain evenly moist, especially during head development.<br><br>

                            <strong>Soil Requirements:</strong> Prefers rich, loamy, well-drained soil with pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Organic matter like compost or aged manure boosts nutrient availability.<br><br>

                            <strong>Sunlight Needs:</strong> Needs 6–8 hours of full sun daily. In hot climates, partial shade can help prevent premature bolting.<br><br>

                            <strong>Temperature Tolerance:</strong> Broccoli thrives in cool conditions, with optimal growth between 16°C and 20°C. Temperatures above 29°C may reduce head quality.<br><br>

                            <strong>Fertilizer Needs:</strong> Requires nitrogen for leafy growth, potassium for plant health, and boron to prevent hollow stems.<br><br>

                            <strong>Irrigation Needs:</strong> Drip irrigation is preferred for consistent moisture and reduced disease risk.<br><br>

                            <strong>Seed Spacing & Density:</strong> Space plants 18–24 inches apart in rows 36 inches apart. Aim for 17,500 to 22,500 plants per acre.
