                <h1>BROCCOLI</h1>
                <p>Broccoli is a nutrient-rich, cool-season crop that takes approximately 70 to 100 days to mature from seed to harvest. It thrives when sown between February and April in cooler regions, with optimal growth occurring at temperatures between 10°C and 20°C.
                    For best results, broccoli should be planted in well-drained, loamy soil rich in organic matter, with a slightly acidic pH between 6.0 and 7.0. As a heavy feeder, it requires a balanced fertilizer program emphasizing nitrogen for leafy growth and potassium for overall plant health, along with boron.
                    Broccoli demands a consistent water supply—ideally 35 to 54 liters per 100 square meters daily—and benefits greatly from drip irrigation to maintain root zone moisture and reduce water waste. It grows best in full sun, needing at least 6 to 8 hours of direct light daily, though partial shade can help prevent bolting in hotter climates.
                    With proper spacing—18 to 24 inches between plants and 36 inches between rows—farmers can achieve yields ranging from 5 to 12 tons per hectare, averaging around 8 tons.</p>
