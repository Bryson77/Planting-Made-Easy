                            <h2>Why Start Your Own Garden?</h2>
                            <p>Starting your own garden is more than just planting seeds. It gives you access to fresh, healthy food, reduces grocery costs, and helps you become less dependent on store-bought produce. Gardening is also a peaceful hobby that reduces stress, keeps you active, and connects you to nature. On top of that, you are helping the environment by reducing packaging waste and lowering your carbon footprint.</p>

                            <h2>How to Start a Garden</h2>
                            <p>To begin, choose a spot that gets enough sunlight and has good air circulation. Prepare your soil by removing weeds and mixing in compost for nutrients. Decide what you want to grow—start with easy crops like spinach, tomatoes, or beans. Water your plants regularly and take time to check on their growth. With patience and consistency, your garden will thrive.</p>

                            <!-- Section 3: Gardening Methods -->
                            <section id="methods">
                            <h2>Gardening Methods</h2>
                            <h3>Container Gardening</h3>
                            <p>If you don’t have a lot of space, container gardening is a simple solution. Pots, buckets, or even old tins can be used to grow herbs, tomatoes, and small vegetables. Just make sure your containers have drainage holes and good soil.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Raised Bed Gardening</h3>
                            <p>Raised beds are wooden or brick boxes filled with soil, perfect if your ground soil is rocky or not fertile. They make gardening easier on your back and allow you to control soil quality, drainage, and nutrients better.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Vertical Gardening</h3>
                            <p>Vertical gardening means using walls, trellises, or shelves to grow upwards instead of across the ground. It’s space-saving and also makes your garden look beautiful. Beans, cucumbers, and strawberries are perfect for this method.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Community Gardening</h3>
                            <p>Community gardening brings people together to share land, tools, and knowledge. Everyone works on their plots or contributes to a common garden. It’s not just about growing food—it’s about teamwork, learning, and building friendships.</p>

                            <!-- Section 4: Irrigation Methods -->
                            <section id="irrigation">
                            <h2>Irrigation Methods</h2>
                            <h3>Drip Irrigation</h3>
                            <p>This method delivers water directly to the plant roots through small pipes or tubes. It saves water and ensures your plants get exactly what they need without wastage.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Sprinkler Systems</h3>
                            <p>Sprinklers spread water over a large area, much like rainfall. They’re good for bigger gardens, but can waste water if used during hot, sunny hours.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Manual Watering</h3>
                            <p>Simple and affordable, manual watering uses a watering can or hose. It gives you more control and allows you to check your plants closely, but it can be time-consuming for larger gardens.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Rainwater Harvesting</h3>
                            <p>This eco-friendly method collects rainwater in tanks or barrels for later use in the garden. It saves money and is a sustainable way to water plants.</p>

                            <h2>Fertilizers and Soil Care</h2>
                            <h3>Organic Compost</h3>
                            <p>Compost is made from kitchen scraps and garden waste. It enriches the soil naturally and helps plants grow strong while reducing household waste.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Natural Fertilizers</h3>
                            <p>Fertilizers like bone meal, fish emulsion, or manure provide nutrients without harmful chemicals. They improve soil quality and encourage healthy plant growth.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Eco-Friendly Soil Practices</h3>
                            <p>Avoid overusing chemical fertilizers, as they can damage soil in the long run. Rotate your crops, use mulch to keep soil moist, and let the earthworms do their job—they naturally aerate and enrich your soil.</p>
