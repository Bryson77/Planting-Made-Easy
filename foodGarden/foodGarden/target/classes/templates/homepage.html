	<h2>Your Mission</h2>
	<p>
		As first-year students at Tshwane University of Technology's Faculty of ICT, our group was assigned a project to investigate the theme: <strong>Food Security Through Garden Projects</strong>. 
	</p>
	<p>
		This website presents our summaries of food garden case studies found online and provides our recommendations for how the community can engage in these projects to secure food.
	</p>
