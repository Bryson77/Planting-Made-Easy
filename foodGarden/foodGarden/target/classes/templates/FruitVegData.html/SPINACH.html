                <h1>SPINACH</h1>
                 <img src="pictures\spinach.jfif" alt="A picture of a spinach leaf" class="spinach1">
                <h2>Growth Duration:</h2>
                <p>Spinach can be planted from August to April, with harvest possible within 30–45 days after sowing. In South Africa, the growing period varies by region and season, with cooler areas often producing better yields. Popular varieties like Ford Hook Giant and New Zealand spinach are well-suited to local conditions. The first harvest can begin when leaves are about 10 cm long, and with proper care, plants will continue producing new leaves for several weeks. Some gardeners prefer to harvest whole plants, while others pick outer leaves regularly to extend the productive period. Multiple plantings throughout the season ensure a continuous supply of fresh leaves.</p>
                <h2>Optimal Growing Seasons:</h2>
                <p>Spinach germinates between 2°C and 30°C, with optimal growth occurring between 15°C and 18°C. In South Africa, winter and early spring plantings often yield the best results, particularly in regions like the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. The cooler months help prevent bolting and produce sweeter, more tender leaves. Summer plantings are possible in areas with moderate temperatures or when partial shade is available. Understanding local weather patterns helps time plantings for maximum success, as extreme heat can cause plants to bolt quickly and develop bitter flavour.</p>
                <h2>Water Requirements:</h2>
                <p>Consistent moisture is crucial for spinach, with soil never allowed to dry out completely. In South Africa's drier regions, regular watering is essential, particularly during germination and early growth. Most commercial growers use overhead irrigation or sprinklers to maintain even moisture levels. Mulching with straw or grass clippings helps retain soil moisture and suppress weed growth. Early morning watering is recommended to reduce disease risk and allow leaves to dry before evening.</p>
                <h2>Soil Requirements:</h2>
                <p>Spinach thrives in fertile, sandy loam with high organic matter content and pH between 6.2 and 6.9. In South African conditions, adding compost or well-rotted manure before planting helps improve soil structure and fertility. Good drainage is essential, as waterlogged conditions can lead to root rot and nutrient deficiencies. Regular soil testing helps monitor pH and nutrient levels, allowing for timely adjustments through liming or fertilization. Avoiding acidic soils is particularly important as this affects nutrient availability.</p>

                <h2>Sunlight Needs:</h2>
                <p>While spinach tolerates full sun to light shade, partial shade often produces better results in South Africa's warm climate. Morning sun with afternoon shade helps prevent stress during hot periods and reduces the risk of bolting. In cooler regions or during winter months, full sun exposure can maximize growth and leaf production. Strategic placement near taller plants or structures can provide natural shade during the hottest part of the day.</p>
                <h2>Fertilizer Needs:</h2>
                <p>Apply phosphorus before planting at a rate of 56–112 kg/ha, with additional nitrogen applications during the growing period to support leaf development. South African growers often use organic options like chicken manure or fish emulsion for supplemental feeding. Regular foliar sprays with seaweed extract can boost growth and increase leaf quality. Split fertilizer applications help maintain steady growth and prevent nutrient leaching, particularly in sandy soils.</p>
                <h2>Irrigation Needs:</h2>
                <p>Sprinkler irrigation ensures uniform moisture distribution and supports successful seed germination. In South African conditions, drip systems may also be used, particularly in areas where water conservation is important. Irrigation frequency depends on soil type, weather conditions, and plant growth stage. Most growers monitor soil moisture regularly and adjust watering schedules accordingly to maintain optimal growing conditions.</p>
                <h2>Seed Spacing & Density:</h2>
                <p>Plant rows 50–60 cm apart with plants spaced 15–20 cm within rows. Direct seeding should be done at about 20 mm depth. In South African market gardens, closer spacing may be used for baby leaf production, while wider spacing allows for full-size plant development. Proper spacing ensures good air circulation and makes harvesting easier. Some growers use succession planting, starting new rows every 2-3 weeks for continuous harvest.</p>
