                <h1>CUCUMBER</h1>
                <img src="pictures\cucumber.jfif" alt="A picture of a Cucumber" class="Cucumber1">
                <h2>Growth Duration:</h2>
                <p>Field-grown cucumbers mature in 55 to 60 days, while greenhouse varieties may take over 70 days. In South Africa, the timeline can vary depending on the region and season, with warmer provinces like Limpopo and Mpumalanga often seeing faster growth due to higher temperatures. Cucumbers are quick to germinate, usually sprouting within a week if the soil is warm enough. Regular feeding and consistent watering help the plants grow vigorously, and trellising can improve air circulation and fruit quality. With good care, you can stagger plantings for a continuous harvest throughout the summer, making cucumbers a popular choice for both home gardens and small-scale farms.</p>
                <h2>Optimal Growing Seasons:</h2>
                <p>Plant when soil temperatures exceed 15°C. Cucumbers are sensitive to frost and grow best in warm conditions. In South Africa, cucumbers are typically planted in late spring or early summer, once the risk of frost has passed. The subtropical regions are especially suited to cucumber cultivation, but even cooler areas can produce good crops if planted at the right time. Succession planting every few weeks ensures a steady supply of fresh cucumbers. In regions with unpredictable weather, using mulch or row covers can help protect young seedlings from cold snaps and encourage strong growth.</p>
                <h2>Water Requirements:</h2>
                <p>Cucumbers are heavy feeders, requiring 25 to 50 mm of water per week. Increase watering during flowering and fruiting stages, as dry conditions can lead to bitter fruit and poor yields. In South Africa’s drier regions, supplemental irrigation is often necessary, especially during hot spells or windy weather. Drip irrigation is recommended to deliver water directly to the roots and minimise evaporation. Mulching with straw or bark chips helps retain moisture and keeps the soil temperature stable. Overwatering should be avoided, as soggy soil can lead to root rot and other fungal problems. Consistent watering is essential for producing crisp, juicy cucumbers.</p>

                <h2>Soil Requirements:</h2>
                <p>Fertile, well-drained soil with a pH of 6.5 to 7.5 is ideal. Add compost or aged manure to boost fertility and improve soil structure. In South Africa, soils can be sandy or clay-based, so amending with organic matter is often necessary to ensure good drainage and nutrient availability. Cucumbers are sensitive to compacted soil, so regular cultivation and aeration help maintain healthy root development. Avoid using fresh manure, as it can cause excessive leaf growth at the expense of fruit production. Good drainage is essential, as cucumbers do not tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>
                <h2>Sunlight Needs:</h2>
                <p>Full sun exposure is essential for healthy growth and fruit development. Cucumbers require at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight daily. In hot climates, partial shade during the afternoon can help prevent the soil from overheating and keep fruit sweet and crisp. South African gardeners often plant cucumbers in spots that get morning sun and afternoon shade, especially in regions with intense summer heat. Too much shade can result in leggy plants and small fruit, while too much sun in hot weather can cause stress and early bolting. If growing in containers, move them to follow the sun or use shade cloth during heatwaves to protect the crop and extend the harvest window.</p>
                <h2>Temperature Tolerance:</h2>
                <p>Optimal growth occurs at 30°C during the day and 18°C to 20°C at night. Extreme heat may cause fruit deformities or bitter flavour. In South Africa, cucumbers thrive in warm, humid conditions but can struggle during heatwaves or cold snaps. Protecting young plants from sudden temperature changes with mulch or row covers can help maintain steady growth. With the right care, cucumbers can be grown successfully in many parts of the country, providing a refreshing addition to salads and meals throughout the season.</p>
