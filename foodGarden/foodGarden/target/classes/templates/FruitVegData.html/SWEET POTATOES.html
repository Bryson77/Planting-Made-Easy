                <h1>SWEET POTATO</h1>
                <img src="pictures\sweetpotato.jfif" alt="A picture of sweet potatoes" class="sweetpotato1">
                <h2>Growth Duration:</h2>
                <p>Sweet potatoes take 90 to 150 days to mature, with significant variation between varieties. Early types like Beauregard and Georgia Jet mature faster (90 days), while Jewel and Stokes take up to 120 days. In South Africa, the growing period can be influenced by soil temperature and local climate conditions. Coastal regions like KwaZulu-Natal often see faster growth due to warm, humid conditions. Most farmers start with vine cuttings rather than tubers, which helps ensure disease-free crops and consistent yields. The first signs of maturity appear when leaves begin to yellow, though many growers check tuber size by careful digging before deciding when to harvest.</p>
                <h2>Optimal Growing Seasons:</h2>
                <p>Best planted from January to March in South Africa, when soil temperatures consistently exceed 20°C. The warm soil and long days of late summer support vigorous growth and good tuber development. In frost-free areas like Limpopo and Mpumalanga, planting can extend into April. Many commercial growers use black plastic mulch to warm the soil earlier in the season and suppress weed growth. Timing plantings to avoid both frost and excessive heat helps ensure successful establishment and optimal yields.</p>
                <h2>Yield Per Area:</h2>
                <p>Yields typically range from 25 to 30 tons per hectare, with top-performing farms exceeding 40 tons. In South African conditions, good management practices including proper spacing, regular weeding, and adequate irrigation can significantly boost productivity. Small-scale farmers often achieve 15-20 tons per hectare, while home gardeners can expect 3-5 kg per square meter in well-prepared beds. The choice of variety, soil fertility, and pest management all play crucial roles in determining final yields.</p>
                <h2>Water Requirements:</h2>
                <p>Requires 450 to 600 mm of water during the growing season, with critical needs during vine establishment and tuber formation. While sweet potatoes are drought-tolerant once established, consistent moisture improves yield and quality. In South Africa's drier regions, supplemental irrigation is essential, particularly during the first month after planting. Many growers use drip irrigation to conserve water and prevent leaf diseases. Mulching helps retain soil moisture and regulate soil temperature.</p>

                <h2>Soil Requirements:</h2>
                <p>Prefers permeable, slightly acidic soil (pH 6.0–6.5) rich in nutrients and organic matter. South African growers often prepare raised beds to improve drainage and facilitate harvesting. Sandy loam soils produce the best-shaped tubers, though sweet potatoes can grow in various soil types if well-drained. Adding compost or well-rotted manure before planting improves soil structure and fertility. Avoid compacted or waterlogged soils, as these can lead to misshapen tubers and rot.</p>
                <h2>Sunlight Needs:</h2>
                <p>Requires 6 to 8 hours of full sunlight daily for optimal growth and tuber development. In South Africa's intense summer sun, some afternoon shade can be beneficial, particularly in the northern regions. Good leaf coverage helps protect developing tubers from sunscald and maintains soil moisture. Proper spacing ensures each plant receives adequate light for photosynthesis and vine growth.</p>
                <h2>Temperature Tolerance:</h2>
                <p>Thrives in warm, humid conditions between 29°C and 35°C, making it well-suited to South Africa's subtropical regions. While temperatures above 38°C may slow growth, established plants can manage with proper irrigation and mulching. Night temperatures should stay above 15°C for optimal growth. In cooler areas, black plastic mulch helps maintain soil warmth and extends the growing season.</p>
                <h2>Fertilizer Needs:</h2>
                <p>Requires balanced nutrition with nitrogen for vine growth, potassium for tuber development, and phosphorus for root health. South African farmers typically apply a base fertilizer before planting and follow up with side dressings as needed. Organic options include well-composted manure and bone meal. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which can promote vine growth at the expense of tuber development. Regular soil testing helps determine specific nutrient needs for optimal growth.</p>
