                <h1>TOMATOES</h1>
                <img src="pictures\tomato.jfif" alt="A picture of a tomato" class="tomato1">
                <h2>Growth Duration:</h2>
                <p>Tomatoes take 60 to over 100 days to harvest depending on the variety. Early types mature faster, while indeterminate varieties produce fruit over a longer period. In South Africa, popular varieties like Heinz and Moneymaker typically start bearing fruit within 70-80 days after transplanting. Cherry tomatoes often fruit earlier, making them a quick choice for impatient gardeners. The coastal regions of KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape can support year-round production with proper timing and protection. Most determinate varieties will produce their crop over a 4-6 week period, while indeterminate types can continue bearing until frost or extreme heat ends the season.</p>
                <h2>Optimal Growing Seasons:</h2>
                <p>In South Africa, sow seeds between August and January. Start seedlings indoors and transplant after the last frost when soil warms up. The main planting season varies by region, with inland areas waiting until September to avoid late frosts. Coastal gardeners often get two growing seasons, planting in early spring and again in late summer. Using shade cloth or tunnels can extend the growing season and protect plants from harsh summer sun. Many commercial growers in Limpopo and Mpumalanga use greenhouses for year-round production, controlling temperature and humidity for optimal growth.</p>
                <h2>Water Requirements:</h2>
                <p>Tomatoes need 25-50mm of water per week, with requirements increasing during flowering and fruiting. Deep, consistent watering is crucial to prevent blossom end rot and fruit splitting. In South Africa's drier regions, drip irrigation is essential for water conservation and disease prevention. Mulching with straw or plastic helps retain soil moisture and suppress weeds. Morning watering allows foliage to dry before evening, reducing disease risk. During peak summer heat, additional watering may be needed to prevent flower drop and maintain fruit development.</p>
                <h2>Soil Requirements:</h2>
                <p>Tomatoes prefer well-drained, fertile soil with a slightly acidic pH of 6.2 to 6.8. Adding compost improves structure and nutrient retention. South African soils often need organic matter incorporation to improve fertility and water-holding capacity. Many successful growers use raised beds or containers with premium potting mix for better control over soil conditions. Regular soil testing helps monitor nutrient levels and pH, allowing for timely adjustments. Avoid planting in areas where other nightshade family crops have recently grown to prevent disease buildup.</p>

                <h2>Sunlight Needs:</h2>
                <p>Full sun exposure of 6 to 8 hours daily is essential for robust growth and fruit development. In South Africa's intense summer sun, light afternoon shade can prevent sun scald on fruit, particularly in the northern provinces. Good air circulation between plants helps prevent disease while ensuring adequate light penetration to lower leaves. Proper pruning and trellising improve light distribution throughout the plant canopy, leading to better fruit quality and yield.</p>
                <h2>Temperature Range:</h2>
                <p>Optimal growth occurs between 26°C and 29°C, with fruit set best between 18-24°C. While tomatoes tolerate 10°C to 34°C, extreme temperatures affect fruit quality and yield. In South African conditions, afternoon shade and regular watering help plants cope with summer heat. Night temperatures below 10°C or above 20°C can affect fruit set and development. Many gardeners use frost protection or greenhouses to extend the growing season in cooler regions.</p>
                <h2>Fertilizer Needs:</h2>
                <p>Use a balanced NPK fertilizer with calcium and magnesium, essential for preventing blossom end rot. In South African soils, additional calcium may be needed, often supplied through gypsum or lime applications. Organic options include well-rotted manure, compost tea, and bone meal. Side-dress plants monthly during the growing season to maintain vigor and fruit production. Foliar feeding with seaweed extract can boost plant health and stress resistance.</p>
                <h2>Irrigation Needs:</h2>
                <p>Drip irrigation delivers water directly to the root zone, minimizing evaporation and disease risk. In South Africa's hot climate, irrigation timing is crucial - early morning watering is preferred. Soil moisture monitors help maintain optimal water levels without overwatering. Commercial growers often use automated systems with moisture sensors for precise water management. Mulching around plants helps conserve moisture and maintain even soil temperature.</p>
                <h2>Seed Spacing & Density:</h2>
                <p>Space plants 60-90 cm apart with rows 120-150 cm apart to ensure good airflow and light penetration. Proper spacing helps prevent disease spread and makes maintenance easier. In intensive gardens, vertical growing systems can increase yield per square meter while maintaining good air circulation. Commercial growers often use wider spacing for mechanical cultivation and harvest operations. Trellising or caging helps support heavy fruit loads and keeps plants upright for better sun exposure.</p>
