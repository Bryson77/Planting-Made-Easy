            <p><strong>Planting Made Easy</strong> is a website and mobile app created to help South Africans grow their own food gardens — easily, affordably, and confidently.</p>
            <p>Food insecurity is a growing challenge across the world, and South Africa is no exception. Many communities lack access to fresh, healthy food — but we believe the solution can start right at home, in the soil.</p>
            <p>Our goal is to use simple technology to empower individuals, families, and schools to grow sustainable gardens — whether in backyards, schoolyards, or small plots. We offer tools, tips, and guides tailored to South African conditions.</p>
            <p>With the right knowledge and support, anyone can grow their own food. Let's grow together — one seed at a time.</p>
