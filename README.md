# Farming Project - Smart Crop Guide  

## Overview  
The **Smart Crop Guide** is an interactive web-based tool designed to help farmers make informed decisions about their crops. With a simple search, users can access detailed information on various fruits, including best growing conditions, water requirements, soil preferences, and potential pests. Additionally, an intelligent **Farm Calculator** assists farmers in optimizing resource allocation based on parameters such as plot size, water availability, and season.

## Features  
- **Fruit Search:** Enter the name of a fruit to get essential details, including ideal climate, soil type, water needs, and fertilization recommendations.  
- **Farm Calculator:** Customize calculations based on factors like land size, water resources, and growing season.  
- **Pest Control & Soil Health:** Gain insights into common pests affecting specific crops and learn about eco-friendly solutions.  
- **Sustainability Insights:** Recommendations on recycling, composting, and efficient water use for sustainable farming.  

## How It Works  
1. **Search for a Fruit:** Type in the name of a fruit in the search bar.  
2. **Get Facts:** View all relevant growing details, including soil preferences, ideal temperature, sunlight needs, and common pests.  
3. **Use the Calculator:** Input key farming parameters like plot size and available water to get customized estimates on resources required.  
4. **Optimize Your Farming:** Use the insights to make better decisions for increasing yield while minimizing waste.  

## Future Enhancements
