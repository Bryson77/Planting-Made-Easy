                        <h1>How to Start a Garden</h1>

                            <h2>Choose the Right Spot</h2>
                            <p>Pick an area that receives at least 6–8 hours of sunlight daily and has good air circulation. This helps plants grow stronger and reduces the risk of diseases.</p>

                            <h2>Prepare the Soil</h2>
                            <p>Remove weeds and loosen the soil before planting. Mix in compost or organic matter to improve fertility, water retention, and drainage.</p>

                            <h2>Decide What to Grow</h2>
                            <p>Begin with easy crops such as spinach, tomatoes, or beans. These are low-maintenance and provide a rewarding harvest for beginners.</p>

                            <h2>Spacing and Planting</h2>
                            <p>Give each plant enough room to grow. Spinach needs about 10–15 cm spacing, while tomatoes need 45–90 cm. Proper spacing prevents overcrowding and disease.</p>

                            <h2>Watering</h2>
                            <p>Most vegetables need about 2.5 cm of water per week. Water deeply 1–2 times a week rather than sprinkling lightly every day. Early morning is the best time to water.</p>

                            <h2>Fertiliser</h2>
                            <p>Use compost or a balanced fertiliser to supply nutrients. Leafy vegetables benefit from nitrogen-rich fertiliser, while fruiting plants like tomatoes need potassium and phosphorus during flowering and fruiting.</p>

                            <h2>Maintenance</h2>
                            <p>Check your garden regularly for weeds, pests, and diseases. Remove weeds early, rotate crops each season, and encourage beneficial insects such as ladybugs.</p>

                            <h2>Be Patient</h2>
                            <p>Gardening takes time, care, and consistency. With regular watering, feeding, and observation, your garden will thrive and reward you with fresh produce.</p>
