                <h1>BROCCOLI</h1>
                <img src="Pictures\BroccoliPlant.jfif" alt="A picture of broccoli" class="Broccoli1">
                <h2>Growth Duration:</h2>
                <p>Broccoli takes 70 to 100 days to mature from seed, depending on the variety. Early types are ready in 60–75 days, while late-season varieties may take longer. In South Africa, the cooler provinces like the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal are ideal for growing broccoli, as the mild temperatures help the heads form tightly and avoid bolting. Gardeners often start seeds indoors or in seed trays before transplanting to the garden, which can give the plants a head start and improve yields. Regular feeding with compost or organic fertiliser helps the plants grow vigorously, and keeping an eye out for pests like aphids and caterpillars is important for a healthy crop. Once the heads are firm and compact, they should be harvested promptly to avoid flowering and loss of quality.</p>
                <h2>Optimal Growing Seasons:</h2>
                <p>Best planted in cooler months—February to April. Ideal temperatures range from 10°C to 20°C, which promote compact head formation. In South Africa, broccoli is often grown as a winter crop, taking advantage of the cooler weather and reduced pest pressure. Planting in autumn allows the plants to mature before the heat of summer arrives, which can cause heads to loosen and flavour to decline. If you’re growing in warmer regions, partial shade or mulching can help keep the soil cool and extend the harvest period. Succession planting every few weeks ensures a steady supply of fresh broccoli throughout the season.</p>

                <h2>Yield Per Area:</h2>
                <p>Yields range from 5 to 12 tons per hectare, averaging around 8 tons. Proper spacing, pest control, and soil fertility are key to maximizing output. In home gardens, each plant can produce a large central head and several smaller side shoots after the main harvest, giving you more value from each plant. South African growers often use drip irrigation and organic mulches to maintain soil moisture and reduce weed competition, which helps boost yields. Regular monitoring for pests and diseases, such as clubroot and downy mildew, is important for keeping plants healthy and productive.</p>
                <h2>Water Requirements:</h2>
                <p>Requires 250–300 mm of water per week. Soil should remain evenly moist, especially during head development. In South Africa’s drier regions, supplemental irrigation is often necessary, particularly during dry spells or windy weather. Drip irrigation is recommended to deliver water directly to the roots and minimise evaporation. Mulching with straw or bark chips helps retain moisture and keeps the soil temperature stable. Overwatering should be avoided, as soggy soil can lead to root rot and other fungal problems. Consistent watering is key to producing crisp, tender broccoli heads.</p>

                <h2>Soil Requirements:</h2>
                <p>Prefers rich, loamy, well-drained soil with pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Organic matter like compost or aged manure boosts nutrient availability. In South Africa, soils can be sandy or clay-based, so amending with organic material is often necessary to improve structure and fertility. Broccoli is a heavy feeder, so regular applications of balanced fertiliser or liquid seaweed can help maintain growth. Avoid planting in soil that has recently grown other brassicas, as this can increase the risk of soil-borne diseases. Good drainage is essential, as broccoli does not tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>
                <h2>Sunlight Needs:</h2>
                <p>Needs 6–8 hours of full sun daily. In hot climates, partial shade can help prevent premature bolting. South African gardeners often plant broccoli in spots that get morning sun and afternoon shade, especially in regions with intense summer heat. Too much shade can result in leggy plants and small heads, while too much sun in hot weather can cause stress and early flowering. If growing in containers, move them to follow the sun or use shade cloth during heatwaves to protect the crop and extend the harvest window.</p>
