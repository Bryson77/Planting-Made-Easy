                <h1>MAIZE</h1>
                <img src="pictures\maize.jfif" alt="A picture of Maize" class="Maize1">
                <h2>Growth Duration:</h2>
                <p>Maize matures in 60 to 100 days depending on the variety. Early hybrids grow faster, while late-season types take longer. In South Africa, the timing can be influenced by local climate and rainfall patterns, with warmer provinces like Limpopo and Mpumalanga often seeing quicker growth. Maize is usually planted at the start of the rainy season to ensure enough moisture for germination and early development. Farmers and gardeners monitor the crop closely during the first few weeks, as strong root and stalk growth are crucial for supporting healthy cobs later on. With good care, maize can be harvested over several weeks, providing a staple food for many households and communities.</p>
                <h2>Optimal Growing Seasons:</h2>
                <p>In South Africa, plant between late October and mid-December. Timing depends on rainfall onset in dryland regions. Maize is sensitive to frost, so planting after the last frost date is important for good establishment. In the summer rainfall areas, planting early ensures the crop matures before the dry winter sets in. Gardeners in cooler regions may need to wait for soil temperatures to rise before sowing. Succession planting can help spread out the harvest and reduce the risk of crop loss due to unpredictable weather.</p>
                <h2>Water Requirements:</h2>
                <p>Requires 500–750 mm of rainfall annually. Supplemental irrigation may be needed during dry spells. Water every 3–7 days depending on growth stage. In South Africa’s drier provinces, irrigation is often used to maintain consistent moisture, especially during flowering and grain filling. Drip irrigation is recommended for water efficiency and to reduce disease risk. Mulching helps retain soil moisture and keeps roots cool during hot spells. Overwatering should be avoided, as soggy soil can lead to root rot and poor grain quality.</p>
                 <img src="pictures\maizeplant.jfif" alt="A picture of Maize" class="Maize2">
                <h2>Soil Requirements:</h2>
                <p>Prefers deep, well-drained soil with good texture and structure. pH should be above 4.5. Lime may be added to correct acidity. In South Africa, soils can be sandy or clay-based, so adding compost or manure improves fertility and structure. Maize is a heavy feeder, so regular applications of balanced fertiliser help maintain growth. Good drainage is essential, as maize does not tolerate waterlogged conditions. Soil testing before planting is recommended to check nutrient levels and pH.</p>
                <h2>Sunlight Needs:</h2>
                <p>Full sun is essential for photosynthesis and grain development. Maize should be planted in open areas where it receives at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight daily. In South Africa, maize fields are often positioned to maximise exposure, as shade can reduce yields and lead to weak stalks. If growing in a home garden, avoid planting maize near tall trees or buildings that may block sunlight.</p>

                <h2>Temperature Tolerance:</h2>
                <p>Flowering occurs best between 19°C and 25°C. Extreme heat or cold can reduce yield. In South Africa, maize is best grown during the warm summer months, as cold snaps can stunt growth and delay maturity. High temperatures above 30°C may cause poor pollination or grain filling, so regular watering and mulching are important during heatwaves. Protecting young seedlings from sudden temperature changes helps ensure a strong, healthy crop.</p>
                <h2>Fertilizer Needs:</h2>
                <p>Requires phosphorus and potassium during growth. Nitrogen boosts leaf and stalk development. In South Africa, many farmers use organic fertilisers such as chicken manure or commercial blends tailored for maize. Fertiliser should be applied at planting and again during early growth stages. Regular feeding and consistent watering will help your maize grow strong and produce abundant, healthy cobs. Good nutrition also helps the plants resist pests and diseases, ensuring a reliable harvest.</p>
                <h2>Irrigation Needs:</h2>
                <p>Drip irrigation improves water efficiency and grain yield. Depth and frequency affect productivity. In South Africa, drip systems are increasingly popular for conserving water and delivering moisture directly to the roots. Irrigation should be adjusted based on soil type and weather, with more frequent watering during hot, dry spells. Monitoring soil moisture helps prevent stress and supports steady growth throughout the season.</p>
                <h2>Seed Spacing & Density:</h2>
                <p>Space plants 13–15 cm apart. Rows should be spaced to allow airflow and light penetration. Proper spacing helps prevent disease and ensures each plant has enough room to develop strong roots and stalks. In South Africa, farmers often use mechanical planters for large fields, while home gardeners can sow seeds by hand, making sure to keep rows straight and evenly spaced. Good spacing also makes it easier to weed, fertilise, and harvest the crop.</p>
