                <h1>LETTUCE</h1>
                 <img src="pictures\lettuce.jfif" alt="Lettuce Head" class="lettuce1">
                <h2>Growth Duration:</h2>
                <p>Lettuce matures in 60 to 90 days depending on the variety. Leaf types grow faster than head-forming varieties like iceberg. In South Africa, gardeners often prefer loose-leaf varieties for quick harvests, while crisphead types take a bit longer but offer a firmer texture. Lettuce is usually sown directly into the soil or started in seed trays for transplanting. Germination is quick, often within a week, and regular thinning helps ensure healthy, full heads. With staggered sowing, you can enjoy a continuous supply of fresh lettuce throughout the season, making it a staple in local gardens and urban plots.</p>
                <h2>Optimal Growing Seasons:</h2>
                <p>Lettuce thrives in cool weather, ideally between 16°C and 18°C. Plant in early spring or autumn to avoid heat stress and bolting. In South Africa, autumn and winter plantings are popular, especially in the Western Cape and Gauteng, where cooler temperatures help produce crisp, sweet leaves. Summer planting is possible in shaded areas or with heat-tolerant varieties, but extra care is needed to prevent bolting. Succession planting every few weeks ensures a steady harvest, and using shade cloth or mulch can help protect young seedlings from sudden temperature changes.</p>

                <h2>Yield Per Area:</h2>
                <p>Yields typically range from 20 to 30 tons per hectare under good management. Proper spacing and pest control help maximize output. In home gardens, lettuce is often grown in raised beds or containers to ensure loose, fertile soil. South African growers use drip irrigation and organic mulches to maintain moisture and reduce weed competition, which helps boost yields. Regular monitoring for pests like aphids and snails is important for healthy crops. With good care, lettuce can be harvested over several months, providing a fresh addition to salads and sandwiches.</p>
                <h2>Water Requirements:</h2>
                <p>Requires consistent moisture, especially during germination and head formation. Overwatering can lead to root rot, while underwatering causes bitterness. In South Africa’s drier regions, supplemental irrigation is often necessary, particularly during hot spells or windy weather. Drip irrigation is recommended to deliver water directly to the roots and minimise evaporation. Mulching with straw or bark chips helps retain moisture and keeps the soil temperature stable. Consistent watering is essential for producing crisp, tender lettuce leaves.</p>

                <h2>Soil Requirements:</h2>
                <p>Prefers well-drained, loamy soil rich in organic matter. Ideal pH is between 5.5 and 7.0. Compost improves structure and fertility. In South Africa, soils can be sandy or clay-based, so adding organic matter is often necessary to improve structure and nutrient availability. Lettuce is sensitive to compacted soil, so regular cultivation and aeration help maintain good root development. Avoid using fresh manure, as it can cause excessive leaf growth at the expense of head formation. Good drainage is essential, as lettuce does not tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>
                <h2>Sunlight Needs:</h2>
                <p>Full sun is preferred, but partial shade helps in warmer climates to prevent bolting. South African gardeners often plant lettuce in spots that get morning sun and afternoon shade, especially in regions with intense summer heat. Too much shade can result in leggy plants and small heads, while too much sun in hot weather can cause stress and early bolting. If growing in containers, move them to follow the sun or use shade cloth during heatwaves to protect the crop and extend the harvest window.</p>
                <h2>Temperature Tolerance:</h2>
                <p>Can grow between 7°C and 18°C, but optimal growth occurs between 16°C and 18°C. High temperatures reduce quality and yield. In South Africa, lettuce is best grown during the cooler months to avoid heat stress and bitterness. Protecting young plants from sudden temperature changes with mulch or row covers can help maintain steady growth. With the right care, lettuce can be grown successfully in many parts of the country, providing a refreshing addition to meals throughout the season.</p>
