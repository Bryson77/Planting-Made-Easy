                <h1>CARROT</h1>
                <img src="Pictures\carrots.jfif" alt="A picture of an carrot" class="Carrot1">
                <h2>Growth Duration:</h2>
                <p>Full-sized carrots take 70–80 days to mature, while shorter types are ready in 55–65 days. In South Africa, the timing can vary depending on the region and season, with cooler provinces like the Western Cape and Free State often producing sweeter, crisper carrots. Carrots are usually sown directly into the soil, as they don’t transplant well. Germination can take up to three weeks, so patience is needed. Regular thinning ensures the roots have space to grow straight and long. With good care, you can stagger plantings for a continuous harvest throughout the year, making carrots a reliable crop for both home gardens and small farms.</p>
                <h2>Optimal Growing Seasons:</h2>
                <p>Plant in early spring or autumn, as carrots tolerate light frost and prefer cooler weather for root development. In South Africa, carrots are grown year-round in many regions, but autumn and spring crops tend to have the best flavour and texture. Hot summer temperatures can cause carrots to become woody or split, so mulching and regular watering help keep the soil cool. Succession planting every few weeks ensures a steady supply of fresh carrots. In frost-prone areas, covering young seedlings with a light mulch can protect them from cold snaps and encourage strong growth.</p>

                <h2>Yield Per Area:</h2>
                <p>Commercial yields range from 9 to 18 tons per acre, with spacing and soil quality affecting root size and quality. In home gardens, carrots are often grown in raised beds or containers to ensure loose, stone-free soil. South African growers use drip irrigation and organic mulches to maintain moisture and reduce weed competition, which helps boost yields. Regular thinning and pest control, especially against carrot fly and aphids, are important for healthy crops. With proper care, carrots can be harvested over several months, providing a nutritious addition to meals and salads.</p>

                <h2>Water Requirements:</h2>
                <p>Carrots need 2.5–5 cm of water weekly, with consistent moisture being key to preventing cracking and promoting even growth. In South Africa’s drier regions, supplemental irrigation is often necessary, especially during hot spells or windy weather. Drip irrigation is recommended to deliver water directly to the roots and minimise evaporation. Mulching with straw or bark chips helps retain moisture and keeps the soil temperature stable. Overwatering should be avoided, as soggy soil can lead to root rot and other fungal problems. Consistent watering is essential for producing crisp, tender carrots.</p>
                <h2>Soil Requirements:</h2>
                <p>Loose, sandy loam with a pH of 6.0–6.8 is ideal, and the soil should be free of stones and clumps to allow roots to grow straight. In South Africa, soils can be sandy or clay-based, so adding organic matter like compost is often necessary to improve structure and fertility. Carrots are sensitive to compacted soil, so regular cultivation and aeration help maintain good root development. Avoid using fresh manure, as it can cause forked roots. Good drainage is essential, as carrots do not tolerate waterlogged conditions.</p>
                <h2>Sunlight Needs:</h2>
                <p>Carrots require 6–8 hours of direct sunlight daily for optimal growth. In hot climates, partial shade during the afternoon can help prevent the soil from overheating and keep roots sweet and crisp. South African gardeners often plant carrots in spots that get morning sun and afternoon shade, especially in regions with intense summer heat. Too much shade can result in leggy plants and small roots, while too much sun in hot weather can cause stress and early bolting. If growing in containers, move them to follow the sun or use shade cloth during heatwaves to protect the crop and extend the harvest window.</p>
